<p>I've covered most of the key components that we often use in real-world applications. There are a few simple toy components that I&nbsp;chose not to cover because it would just waste your time. With the materials you've learned so far, you can easily figure out how to work with these components.&nbsp;</p><p>The only exception is data tables. This component has been going under some changes and I&nbsp;decided not to create a video for it yet because it is very likely that we'll see breaking changes here. So, I'm waiting a bit longer until this component is stable and simplified. Currently, it has a messy and complex API&nbsp;that I'm hoping to be simplified soon.&nbsp;</p>
