<h4>An important note</h4><p>We've reached the end of this section.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the next few sections, we'll be looking at <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>automated testing</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;recorded these sections a while ago with an earlier version of Angular for my older course "Build Enterprise Applications with Angular". But I&nbsp;decided to add them as a bonus to this course so you have all your Angular content in one place and don't need to jump back and forth between different courses.&nbsp;</p><p>Just remember, since I've recorded these videos&nbsp;with an earlier version of Angular, there may be a slight chance for breaking changes. So, if you get stuck, post your question on the discussion board and also help your classmates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That aside, don't get hung up on the minor syntactical changes&nbsp;(if any). Focus on the core principles that you're going to learn over the next few sections. These concepts continue to be valid for the future versions of Angular.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p>
