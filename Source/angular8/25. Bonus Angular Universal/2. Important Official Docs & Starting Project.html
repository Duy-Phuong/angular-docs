<p><strong>Important</strong>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The starting project for this module is attached to this lecture. Please use that project to proceed!</strong></p><p>---</p><p>Setting up Angular Universal can be difficult and - also depending on the exact version of Angular you're using - there is more than one way of getting it to run. </p><p>Also check the official docs in case you get stuck or encounter errors:&nbsp;<a href="https://angular.io/guide/universal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://angular.io/guide/universal</a></p><p>The steps explained there <strong>differ from the more detailed approach</strong> I&nbsp;show you in this module. In the end, you can skip a lot of the manual setup work we do in this module by simply running:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --clientProject your-project-name-as-stored-in-angular.json-file
npm run build:ssr &amp;&amp; npm run serve:ssr</pre><p>I will also update this module in the future to provide more interesting insights &amp;&nbsp;alternatives to create Angular Universal apps.</p>
