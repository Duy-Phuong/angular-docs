<p><strong>Angular 8 was released and it didn't introduce any breaking changes</strong> besides a small temporary one:</p><p><code>@ViewChild(...)</code> now becomes <code>@ViewChild(..., { static: false })</code> - the only exception is, if you plan to use the selected element inside of <code>ngOnInit</code> =&gt; Use <code>@ViewChild(..., { static: true })</code> in that case. <code>@ViewChild(...)</code> with one argument only will cause an error in Angular 8.</p><p>Read the <strong>official announcement blog post</strong> to learn more about improvements introduced by Angular 8: <a href="https://blog.angular.io/version-8-of-angular-smaller-bundles-cli-apis-and-alignment-with-the-ecosystem-af0261112a27?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://blog.angular.io/version-8-of-angular-smaller-bundles-cli-apis-and-alignment-with-the-ecosystem-af0261112a27?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------</a></p><p><strong>This entire course is up-to-date with Angular 8</strong>! I also replaced a couple of sections - NOT because Angular 8 broke something (see above) but because @angular/http has been deprecated for a while and was now removed. I therefore replaced all lectures where we used that old Http client with lectures where we now use the new one.</p><p>I also updated the Authentication section to show a more generic approach (instead of using only the Firebase SDK) and I updated all usages of RxJS operators to the <code>pipe(...)</code> syntax, see: <a href="https://academind.com/learn/javascript/rxjs-6-what-changed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academind.com/learn/javascript/rxjs-6-what-changed/</a></p><p>---</p><p><strong>Want to update existing projects? </strong></p><p><code>ng update</code> should do the trick.</p><p>If you're facing issues, visit: <a href="http://update.angular.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://update.angular.io</a></p>
