<p>With the release of Angular 8, I updated a couple of sections in this course (see "Announcements" part of the course).</p><p>This section (about NgRx) was one of the updated sections.</p><p>All the lectures marked as "[LEGACY]" in their title are OLD and taking them is not recommended. If you went through the lectures at the beginning of this module (i.e. without "[LEGACY]" in the title), you took the new, updated version of this module already. Ignore the "[LEGACY]" lectures then.</p><p>Why do the "[LEGACY]" lectures exist?</p><p>I'm keeping them around for students who started this section before I released my update. I'll remove them in the future.</p>
